 # Digital Scent Technology

INTRODUCTION

This is a technology to sense, transmit and receive scent-enabled digital media (such as web pages, video games, movies and music).  This sensing part of this technology works by
using olfactometers and electronic noses.  Digital scent technology is the engineering discipline dealing with olfactory representation.  It is a technology to senses transmit and receive digital media and smell through the internet. 

APPLICATION OF DIGITAL SCENT TECHOLOGY

Digital smell works by continously feeding odors from vaporizing gel pellets into four air streams, one in each corner of the screen.  These air streams are blown our parallel to the 
parallel to the screen's surface by fans, and varying the strength and direction of them spreading the scent to any given spot on the screen.  Effortless interactions in remote work involves bridge remote distances with quick, on-the-fly virtual team interactions.  There is current technology being developed as a scent internet browser mainly as a tool for those with vision impairment.  It is interesting to understand the line of development, but sense of smell has been fascination for many years and we will be surprised at the technology available.  For example, people may be more aware of the fragrance emitting writ watch and alarm clock, to identity the time without sound or slight.

Psychological inflluential clothing that measures core temperature and identifies mmoods and releases fragrances to counteract bad moods, depressive states or to maintain possible moods-its all available to look up.  Our ability to identify age by scent identified studies.  One may think of Digital Scent Technology like unto 3-D printer, and this is operated to the need of the machine that creates and emits the product, but to digitally "transfer" scent all that is needed is code.  So the data is sent across the web for the recipient to access
the smell but the scent molecules themselves did not travel.

Many perfumes are made by extracting sscented oil from natural ingredients.  These ingredients can includes various plants, fruit, woods and even animal secretions.  Other resources like alcohol, coal, tars, and petrochemicals can be used during the manufacturing process.  Fragrance notes are essentially the different scent layers that make up the final fragrance.  The scents are split into three distinct elements.  Top notes, heart notes and base notes.  Together, the top, heart and base notes work together to create a beautiful fragrance.

ORIGIN OF DIGITAL SCENT TECHNOLOGY

The common ingredient found in perfume are beyzel, alcohol, ethanol, ethylacetate, bsenzaldehyde, camhor, formaldehyde, methylene chloride and limonene.  "Dexter Smith and Joel
Lloyd Bellenson" experts in bioinformatics and genomics, started from the following idea: if we can find the essence of a biological smell and build a profile, we can digitalize and broadcast it."  

IN 1999, digiScent developed a computer peripheral device called ismell, which was designed to emit a smell when a user visited a web site or opened an email.  
The device contain a cartridge with 128 “primary odors”, which could be mixed to replicate natural and man-made odors.

PRINCIPAL OF E-NOSE

E-nose is the fundamental principles of artificial nose that each sensored in the array has different sensitivity. Th epattern of reponse acrros the sensors is distinct from different odors. Different E-nose, use different types of gas sense which forms heart of e-nose. The sensor's response is recorded and delivered to the signal prossecing unit and then it is converted into electronic signal by using a transducer and is processed by using the signal processing unit. Signs of sensing an ordant vapor, array of sensors, pattern recognition and then the smelling(a stage of input, processing and output).

DST SCENTING AND COMMUNICATION

Some primary oudrs have been proposed(DST): musky, putrid, pungent, comphoraceous, ethereal, floral and peppermint just to list a few smells. Digital scent communication entails the following: chemical make up, scnets spectrum, scent index, digitizing, primary odor, detached scent and scent bus communication. 

Synthetic musks and phthalates potentially hazardous components as perfume ingredient.
