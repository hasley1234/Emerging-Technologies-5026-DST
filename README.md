are # Digital Scent Technology

INTRODUCTION

This is a technology to sense, transmit and receive scent-enabled digital media (such as web pages, video games, movies and music).  This sensing part of this technology works by
using olfactometers and electronic noses.  Digital scent technology is the engineering discipline dealing with olfactory representation.  It is a technology to senses transmit and receive 
digital media.  With digital scent technology, it is possible to sense, transmit and reaceive smell through the internet. 

Digital smell works by continously feeding odors from vaporizing gel pellets into four air streams, one in each corner of the screen.  These air streams are blown our parallel to the 
parallel to the screen's surface by fans, and varying the strength and direction of them speading the scent to any given spot on the screen.  Effortless interactions in remote work involves
bridge remote distances with quick, on-the-fly virtual team interactions.  There is current technology being developed as a scent internet browser mainly as a tool for those with vision impairment.  It is interesting to understand the line of development, but sense of smell has been fascination for many years and we will be surprised at the technology available.  For example, people may be more aware of the fragrance emitting writ watch and alarm clock, to identity the time without sound or slight.
