QUESTION :  DISCUSS WHETHER DIGITAL SCENT TECHNOLOGY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT JAMAICA AND REST OF THE REGION

ANSWER

This paper will attempt to provides and give a clear analytical knowledge of Digital Scent Technology through the electronical interface on
past and present issues for commercial and domestic effect using chemical odors and the impact of the harzardous environment in Jamaica and the
rest of the region.  I will discuss few matters that affect our nation and the general Caribbean, North and South Americas and the rest of the
world. DST will have an impact on our life forever.  Jamaica is affected with DST impact in the following ways: education, music, movie,
entertainment, video, gaming, health, and many other ways we all use technologies and the internet.

Jamaica as well as the rest of the world encountered DST smelling of chemical reaction and psychological impasse that disturb our emotional
pattern and scenses.  The Caribbean region is a part of a global village and the spirit of scenting and smelling is a worldwide issue. In this
paper, I will embark upon some practical application aspect of DST which will deal with digital communication scenting, marketing  and our 
well-being.  This discussion will also highlight few issues that will affect Jamaica in relation to this scenting of Digital Technologies and the
converging of other technological tools. The use of the Internet, IoT, IoS and E-Nose explain the growing issue thet have an impact of our 
surrounding. The impact of all other technologies is a part of the process of the functionality of Digital Scent Technologies.

It is a fact that DST and the observation of symbiotic relationship between the impact of Jamaica and the Caribbean in the future will suffer 
chemical reaction of technologies of the IoS and E-Nose with the use of other internet services, such as, 3D, 4G, and 5G. I realised that the
interactionism of 6G is fast becoming a reality and this connecting link is now the primary activator of the multisensory expenses the world 
will face. DST is an intertwined communication space  on the Internet of Things that pave the way for the collective transfer of sharing the
five scenses, that we utilize seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and feeling. 

The human computer interaction (HCT) community consider digital olifactory stimulation as a real-life interactionism to be a fundamental step
in broaden the technology relating to multisensory communication. In the Carbbean, the Digital Scent Technology is manipulated  by the growth
of market is driven by growing adoption of E-Noses in food industry for process monitoring, freshness evalulation, and authenticity assessment,
rising adoption of compact, portable, and IoT - enabled E-Noses, growing development of E-Nose devices for diagnosing diseases, and inte-
gration of E-Nose and synthesizers into smartphone homes.





The region as well as Jamaica have impact on Digital Scent Technology where the growing adoption of E-Nose in many industries are engaged
base upon the growth of drivers in the drivers in the market for immersive technologies in the areas of sensory driven immersion, mixed
reality headset, virtual auto, concomitand development of business model, increased use of digital environments for communication and 
education in the Covid 19 pandemic encounter and also in avenue where computer game where research for education and entertainment involvement.
The industries are Amphenol, Sensirion, Renesas, Alphasense, Sciosense, Ecosensor, and Honeywell.

In Jamaica E-Noses objective analysis to be compared to regions are based on inspection, and early detection of spoilage and contamination,
improved shelf-life management, and streamlined production control.  The following island in the regions suffer similar fate, such as,
